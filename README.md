# Binary Search Visualizer

A web-based tool to demonstrate the **binary search algorithm** visually. Input a sorted array and a target value to watch the search process unfold step by step.

## Features

- Accepts user-defined sorted arrays and target numbers.
- Displays the binary search process with a visual representation.
- Provides clear results about the target's presence and position.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Enter a sorted array (comma-separated values) in the input field.
4. Input the target value to search for.
5. Click the **Start Search** button to visualize the binary search process.
6. Check the visualizer and result display for updates.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the webpage.
- **style.css**: Defines the design and styling.
- **script.js**: Implements the binary search logic and visualization.
  
## Future Plans

- Enable step-by-step navigation through each iteration of the search.
- Add support for different search algorithms for comparison.
- Include user-selected themes and animations.
